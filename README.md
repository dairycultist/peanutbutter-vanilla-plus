# Peanutbutter (Vanilla+) [StationAPI]

Minecraft vanilla+ mod that leans into the light medieval fantasy elements of Minecraft, adding content that fleshes out existing mechanics without feeling bloated or incoherent.

## Implemented

*Some of the stuff here isn't actually implemented, and also not everything that's implemented is here (because it's planned to be removed), but I'll fix that when I fix that*

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Implemented features may be WIP and subject to change.

- lonely (no other humans, they're all zombies at best)
- new structures, new mobs (types of zombie, aggressive wildlife like wasps, piranhas, sharks), new blocks, not really new items tho

### New mobs

- Cockatrice
  - Spawn in the nether
  - Drop golden feathers
  - Lay golden eggs
- Mummy
  - Spawns during the day in the desert
  - Zombie equivalent

### Blocks

- Decoration blocks
  - Stone bricks
  - Carved bone
- Ectogel
  - Dropped by ghasts (12-32) (I don't like this particularly but idk what to replace it with)
  - You run faster on it
 
### Tweaks

- Mobs now guaranteed to drop at least 1 of their item

## Planned?

Literally all my ideas good or bad

- Wings
  - made with golden feathers
  - end game gear
  - gives you a double jump
  - not as busted as the elytra but just convenient for exploring/building
- new music disc(s)
- new enemies
  - stone golem
  - goblin
- uncraftable weapons and armor
  - found in structures or as mob drops
  - throwable dynamite
- add new achievements that guide the player through new content

maybe update project dependencies ([reference](https://github.com/telvarost/AmbientOverride-StationAPI/commit/8e2b9abc1d68de11ebf130302313078292ce8a1d))

## Suggested Companion Mods
- [Copper and Caverns](https://modrinth.com/mod/copper-and-caverns)
- A food mod if I ever get around to making/finding one - good food should be made from bad food/non-food (new crops like tomato that stacks to 8 and heals 1 heart) (Curry, shapeless craft with 1 sugar, 1 mushroom, 1 tomato, 1 bowl) (Muffin 8 wheat surrounding 1 sugar)
- Mob texture variations (chicken!)
